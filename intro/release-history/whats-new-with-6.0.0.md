# What's New With 6.0.0

LogBox 6.0.0 is a major release for LogBox. It has some dramatic new features as we keep pushing for more modern and sustainable approaches to web development. We break down the major areas of development below and you can also find the full release notes per library at the end.

## Engine Support

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image.png)

It is also yet another source code reduction due to the dropping of support for the following CFML Engines:

* Adobe ColdFusion 11
* Lucee 4.5

The info-graphic above shows you the supported engines the 6.x platform will support.

## Logging Enhancements

LogBox has been entirely rewritten in script and a more fluent programming approach. It has also been revamped to leverage the scheduling executors and async programming aspects of our async package.  All loggers now sport logging via an async queue and it is completely non-blocking.  If you do heavy logging, the performance will be substantial.

## LogBox Config Path Init

If you are using LogBox in standalone mode, you can now construct it by passing the path to your LogBox configuration file or no path at all and we will construct LogBox with our new default config file to stream logs to the console.

```javascript
application.logbox = new LogBox();

application.logbox = new LogBox( "config.MyLogBox" );
```
