# Creating a Custom Layout

You can easily create a custom layout object by creating a cfc that extends our abstract layout object: `logbox.system.logging.Layout` and implementing a `format()` method. Below you can see the method signature:

```javascript
<---  format --->
<cffunction name="format" output="false" access="public" returntype="string" hint="Format a logging event message into your own format">
    <cfargument name="logEvent" type="logbox.system.logging.LogEvent"   required="true"   hint="The logging event to use to create a message.">
</cffunction>
```

All you need to do is inspect the logging event and create your very own message and then return it back. That's it! You thought there was more?
